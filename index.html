                    ViaMia is patcher and alternative keyboards database for <a href="https://caniusevia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferer noopener">VIA</a>.
                    It allows you to override the official VIA database with our open source one that actually adds new keyboards.
                </p>
                <a href="start" role="button">Just get me started</a>

                <h4>Why create ViaMia?</h4>
                <p>
                    In the custom mechanical keyboard community <a href="https://qmk.fm" target="_blank" rel="noreferer noopener">QMK</a> is king. VIA is an elegant realtime configurator for QMK allowing you to change your keyboard's behavior on the fly.
                    However, VIA has a few flaws:
                    <ol>
                        <li>The app is closed source</li>
                        <li>The keyboard repository has no license (meaning it is copyrighted by many people)</li>
                        <li>Getting keyboards merged into the repository takes ages</li>
                        <li>It restricts itself to keyboards in the official QMK repository</li>
                        <li>If your keyboard is not in the VIA database, you have to manually load your config every time you use VIA</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    ViaMia aims to solve all these problems in an open source friendly way.
                    At the core is the <a href="#patcher">ViaMia Patcher</a> that changes the database used by VIA to an unofficial one.
                    We host our own database in the <a href="#keyboards">ViaMia keyboards repository</a>.
                </p>

                <h4 id="patcher">ViaMia Patcher ü©π</h4>
                <p>
                    Our <a href="https://github.com/ViaMia/ViaMia-Patcher" target="_blank">patcher</a> for VIA changes the data source used by VIA to any other URL.
                    The only requirement is that this URL hosts a <code>keyboards.v2.json</code> file compatible with the official VIA one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The patcher qualifies as an <i>unofficial patch</i><sub><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unofficial_patch" target="_blank" rel="noreferer noopener">wiki</a></sub> to closed source software, meaning it is fully legal. We do not redistribute VIA binaries.
                </p>

                <h4 id="keyboards">ViaMia Keyboards ‚å®Ô∏è</h4>
                <p>
                    Our <a href="https://github.com/ViaMia/ViaMia-Keyboards" target="_blank">keyboards repository</a> holds a database of additional keyboards that work with VIA but are not in the official VIA database.
                    When you've patched your VIA installation with our keyboard database, you, or <abbr title="Anyone using ViaMia">anyone</abbr> with the same keyboard, will no longer need to load the config JSON manually every time VIA is opened.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The repository automatically checks if your VID/PID combination is unique. If that is the case, a maintainer will likely merge your keymap within hours. We hope to have an online VID/PID checker soon so you can avoid conflicts in the first place.
                </p>
